        C-Ratio needs to be at least 300%.<br />
        If your C-Ratio is above 500%, youâ€™ll earn rewards in wNEC.<br />
        If your C-Ratio falls below 300%, your wNEC will be locked (not liquidated) until the C-Ratio goes back to at
        least 300%. That can happen either via NEC price fluctuations or if you add more wNEC as collateral.
